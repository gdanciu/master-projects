This ontology describes the figures in ancient mythologies. These figures divide in immortals (primordial deities, titans, giants and olympian deities) and mortals(demigods, kings, humans and notable women). Each figure has a Sex(male or female), lives in a Place(inferno, sea,sky or village) and belongs to the mythology of a civilisation(roman or greek).
There are family relationships between mythological figures. Some figures may have multiple lovers, but they can have at most one current wife/husband. Each wife/husband is also a lover to his counterpart. The inferred class BigamousFigures emphasizes the figures that have more than one lover.
The data properties isFoundAtHeight emphasizes where a Place is found. The data property hasTemples counts all the temples that one figure has all over the world.
